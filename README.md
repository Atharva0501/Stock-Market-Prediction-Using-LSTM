Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM
Introduction
This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a deep learning model, to predict stock market prices using historical data from Yahoo Finance. The model captures sequential patterns in the data to forecast future stock values.

Features
Data Preprocessing:Normalized data using MinMaxScaler for consistency.
Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.

Model Architecture:
LSTM-based neural network for sequential data prediction.
Hyperparameter optimization with Keras Tuner.

Interactive Web Interface:
Flask app for real-time stock prediction.
Users can input custom stock values and receive predicted closing prices.

Visualization:
Plots of actual vs. predicted prices for performance analysis.
Training and validation loss graphs.

Getting Started
Installation
Clone the repository:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction-lstm.git
cd stock-market-prediction-lstm
Install required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Flask App:
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Web Interface:
Open a browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Input stock data (e.g., open, high, low prices) and get the predicted closing price.
Results
Validation Loss: Achieved a minimum validation loss of 0.0012 after hyperparameter tuning.
Visualization: Generated graphs comparing actual vs. predicted prices to validate the model's performance.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Keras, TensorFlow
NumPy, pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Flask
Data Source
The historical stock data was sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Future Enhancements
Incorporate sentiment analysis from news articles.
Extend the model to predict multiple time steps into the future.
Add real-time stock data fetching using APIs.
